# David Howell's macOS Workstation Setup

This repository collects automations and configuration settings that are foundational to how I use macOS.

**OmniFocus Automations** are stored in `omnifocus-plugins`. Install these by opening Automation > Configure in OmniFocus and then adding the plugin directory as a Linked Folder.
